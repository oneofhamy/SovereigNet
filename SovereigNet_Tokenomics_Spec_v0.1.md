| Token Name       | Transferable | Description                                                           |
|------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| $SOVR (main)     | Yes          | Core utility/governance token. Used for voting, staking, and access. |
| $REP (Reputation)| No           | Earned non-transferable token reflecting trust, contributions, etc.  |
| Soulbound ID     | No           | Proof-of-Humanity credential. Required for participation in voting.  |

### **Utility of $SOVR:**

**1. Quadratic Voting Rights**

Users use $SOVR to cast weighted votes on network-wide decisions.

Cost per vote increases quadratically (e.g. 1 vote = 1 token, 2 votes = 4 tokens, etc.)



**2. Treasury Governance**

Proposals to fund projects or initiatives require $SOVR stake to submit.

Voting on grants or ecosystem bounties uses $SOVR.



**3. Anti-Spam & Posting Throttle**

Posting in high-impact feeds costs micro-fees in $SOVR (burned or routed to treasury).

Encourages signal over noise without paywalls.



**4. Staking & Moderation Bounties**

Moderators stake $SOVR to enforce policies; can be slashed if abusing power.

Community bounty rewards can be paid in $SOVR.



**5. Peer-to-Peer Value Transfer**

Optional tipping, peer contracting, or p2p paid content.

**Flow Description**:

- **Users** contribute tokens (posting, voting, staking).
- Tokens flow to the **Treasury**, governed by the **DAO**.
- The DAO allocates funding to **Grants** (projects).
- **Projects** lead to **Network Growth**.
- Growth creates **Token Demand**, driving value back to **Users**.

**Value Accrual Model:**

Governance Power: The more $SOVR you hold, the more you can influence outcomes — but quadratic costs prevent whales from dominating.

Network Activity: More activity (posting, funding, voting) means more demand for $SOVR.

Treasury Leverage: Funded projects must use or return $SOVR. Success creates feedback loops.

Staking Incentives: Users are incentivized to lock $SOVR to earn roles or fees, reducing circulating supply.
