#**SovereigNet Minimum Viable Product Roadmap**

**Goal:**

Build the foundation of SovereigNet with just enough features to test user flow, privacy, governance, and reward infrastructure.

**MVP Core Components:**

Identity and PoH system using ZK-proofs (opt-in)

Anonymous user registration and profile creation

Text-based post & comment system (IPFS-backed)

Encrypted direct messaging (peer-to-peer)

Community nomination and voting framework for proposals

Quadratic voting for proposals and elections

Reward token with wallet support

Treasury smart contract + community chest tax logic

On-chain publishing of all proposals and vote results (post-election)

Stake signaling + support metrics (not vote-weighted)

Participation rewards distribution

#**Full Development Roadmap**

â€”

#**Phase 1: Infrastructure & MVP**

**Objective:**

Build secure, scalable backbone and test governance.

**Features:**

Core blockchain selection & deployment

IPFS / decentralized file system integration

PoH ZK-protocol (select one approach: biometrics hash, social proof, or DIDs)

Identity verification + pseudonymous profiles

Text-based posting, commenting (IPFS content, on-chain references)

Wallet integration and reward token deployment

Smart contracts for:

Proposal lifecycle (nomination, voting, result finalization)

Quadratic voting with final-round logic

Treasury & taxation

Reward distribution

Encrypted peer-to-peer direct messaging (Libp2p / Matrix / WebRTC-based)

Nomination + election structure

Voting interfaces (with vote concealment until end)

---

#**Phase 2: Feature Expansion & Community Tools**

**Objective:**

Broaden engagement, improve UX, secure governance.

**Features:**

Multimedia support (images/audio via IPFS, thumbnails streamed)

Structured candidate profiles for elections (history, platform, etc.)

Discussion boards and forums (threaded, topic-based)

Reward token DeFi integration:

LP staking

Yield farming hooks

Collateralization options

**Role-based permissions:**

Auditor, treasurer, moderator, reviewer

Bracket-style runoff implementation

Vote randomization interface (to prevent strategic ordering)

Public but anonymous vote publishing (with proofs)

Dispute resolution system (emergency proposal reversals)

Candidate support staking (trust signals only)

---

#**Phase 3: Ecosystem Growth & Interoperability**

**Objective:**

Integrate SovereigNet into the broader crypto ecosystem.

**Features:**

NFT profile badges and verifications (optional)

Cross-chain bridges (e.g., to Ethereum, Cosmos, Polkadot)

External plugin support (developer API + SDK)

Anonymous video/audio group chat (optional)

Creator revenue tools (direct tipping, tokenized content access)

Open marketplace module (token-gated services)

Decentralized moderation layer:

Reputation systems

Community flag/vote moderation

Layer-2 or subnet migration (for scalability)

Automatic on-chain auditing framework for treasury usage

---

#**Phase 4: Sovereign Resilience**

**Objective:**

Make SovereigNet resistant to failure, takeover, and centralization.

**Features:**

Full node launcher (easy-to-deploy GUI clients for community)

On-chain community service registry (offer/need boards)

Anti-spam machine learning layer (runs locally)

Decentralized app index (for plug-and-play microservices)

Multilingual support

Mesh-network fallback (LoRa/mesh relay-ready client layer)

Disaster recovery / data replication protocol



---

#**Development Roles and Teams to Recruit**

Blockchain engineers (smart contracts, Layer-2)

ZK cryptographers (PoH design)

P2P systems developers (Libp2p, WebRTC)

UX designers (low-latency encrypted social UI)

Community governance facilitators

Security auditors and bounty managers
